# Personalized Study Plan Optimization

This project aims to help students optimize their study plan by allocating study hours across various subjects using Linear Programming. The app calculates the optimal study hours for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics based on user-defined constraints and preferences. The solution is generated using the `PuLP` library for linear programming and is deployed using **Streamlit** for easy access through a web interface.

## Features
- Optimize study hours for subjects based on user-defined priorities.
- Adjust study time according to the available hours and subject importance.
- Solve using Linear Programming to maximize study effectiveness.

## Requirements

1. **Python** (version 3.x)
2. **Libraries**:
   - `pulp` (for linear programming optimization)
   - `streamlit` (for the interactive web app)
   - `pandas` (for handling data and outputs)
   - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
